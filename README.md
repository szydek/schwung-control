# Custom MIDI controller for Schwung

Customisable MIDI controller for use on Ableton Move with Schwung installed.

## Prerequisites

- [Schwung](https://github.com/charlesvestal/schwung) installed on your Ableton Move

## Features

- 16 Banks of custom pads/knobs/buttons
- Configurable MIDI channel per bank, and per pad/knob/button
- Configurable output destination per bank, and per pad
- Adjust Pad (level) velocity for bank and individual pads
- Change MIDI note for pads or cc for pads/knobs/buttons
- Change colour of banks, pads, knobs and buttons
- Assign a name to banks, pads, knobs and buttons
- Change knobs between relative or absolute values
- Optional Knob Pages per bank: top pad row (25-32) becomes page selectors for 8 pages of knob mappings
- Adjust pad mode per bank and per pad (Note/CC)
- Adjust pad release behaviour per bank and per pad (Pad Offs, including Toggle)
- Adjust button release behaviour per bank and per button (Button Offs, including Toggle)
- Open from Tools Menu (Shift + Step13)
- Three output options: external, move, schwung

> **Note:** When you change a bank-level setting for MIDI Channel, Pad Offs, Pad Mode, Button Offs, or Output, any matching individual pad/knob/button overrides for that bank are reset to follow the bank setting again.

## Advanced Features

### Choke Groups

Choke groups allow pads to **cut each other off** when triggered - perfect for hi-hats!

**How it works:**
1. Set multiple pads to the same choke group (1-8)
2. When you press pad A (choke group 1)
3. Any other pad in choke group 1 that's playing will be stopped
4. This creates realistic hi-hat open/close behavior

**Example Setup:**
```
Pad 1: Hi-Hat Closed  - Choke Group 1
Pad 2: Hi-Hat Open    - Choke Group 1
Pad 3: Hi-Hat Pedal   - Choke Group 1
```

Now playing "closed" automatically stops "open" and vice versa!

**Tip:** Use choke group 0 (default setting) to disable choking for a pad.

### Velocity Scaling

Control how sensitive pads are to your playing dynamics:

**Pad Level (per pad):**
- 50% = Half velocity
- 100% = Normal (default)
- 200% = Double velocity

**Master Pad Level (per bank):**
- Multiplies ALL pad velocities in the bank

**Min Pad Level (per bank):**
- Minimum velocity of ALL pads in the bank

**Formula:**
```
Output Velocity = Input × (Pad Level / 100) × (Master Level / 100) > Minimum Pad Level || Minimum Pad Level
```

**Example:**
```
Input: 100
Pad Level: 90%
Master Level: 150%
Output: 100 × 0.9 × 1.5 = 135 (max capped at 127, min at Bank's Min Pad Level)
```

### Output Options

**Output (external):** MIDI goes to external devices via USB
- Use with external synths, DAWs, or hardware
- Requires MIDI device connected
- Default setting

**Output (move):** MIDI goes to Move's internal instruments
- Use when you want to play Move's built-in drums and/or synths
- No external MIDI device needed

**Output (schwung):** MIDI goes to Schwung's sound generators
- Use when you want to play Schwung's built-in sounds
- No external MIDI device needed

**Tip:** You can have different banks in different output modes - Bank 1 for external gear, Bank 2 for Move's synths, Bank 3 for Schwung!

### Pad-Offs and Button-Offs

**On/Off:** Send note-off when pad or button is released
- Default behaviour for pads
- Use for melodic instruments
- Allows notes to sustain until you release

**On Only:** Don't send note-off or CC Off value messages
- Default behaviour for buttons
- Use for drum machines
- Each hit is independent

**Toggle:** Toggle between note-on/note-off or CC On/Off (127/0) messages
- Use as a control surface


### Relative Knob Mode

**Absolute Mode (default):**
- Knob position = MIDI value
- Jumping when you touch a knob is normal
- Good for parameters with clear ranges

**Relative Mode:**
- Knob sends +/- changes
- No jumping
- Perfect for controlling plugins with existing values
- Good for volume/filter controls

### Knob Pages

Enable **Knob Pages** in a bank's settings to turn the top pad row (pads 25-32) into knob page selectors:

- **Pad 25** selects page 1 - the bank's existing knob mappings
- **Pads 26-32** select pages 2-8 - 7 additional pages of 8 knob mappings each (56 extra mappings per bank)
- The lit pad shows the active page; press another selector to switch
- The master knob is shared across all pages
- Each page's knobs have their own CC, name, colour, range, multiplier and relative/absolute settings - configure them in Settings just like normal knobs

When Knob Pages is off (default), pads 25-32 behave as normal pads. Existing pad configurations are preserved when you toggle the feature, so you can switch it on and off without losing mappings.

### Colour Schemes

**Pads & Buttons:** 0-127 individual colours

**Knobs:** 4 colour schemes (0-3)
- **Scheme 0:** Neutral grays
- **Scheme 1:** Rainbow
- **Scheme 2:** Synthwave (purple/pink/blue)
- **Scheme 3:** Rose (pink gradient)

Knob LEDs change brightness based on value!

### Bank vs Individual Settings

Most bank settings can also be overridden per pad, knob, or button:
- **MIDI Channel** — set per pad/knob/button (`0` = use bank channel)
- **Pad Offs / Pad Mode** — set per pad (`Bank` = use bank setting)
- **Button Offs** — set per button (`Bank` = use bank setting)
- **Output** — set per pad (`Bank` = use bank output)

> **Important:** When you change a bank-level setting for MIDI Channel, Pad Offs, Pad Mode, Button Offs, or Output, any matching individual overrides for that bank are cleared and will follow the bank setting again.
